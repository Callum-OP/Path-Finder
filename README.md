Will try to make a pathfinding algorithm using C++ and SFML.
Included SFML files in the project.

To run it simply open main.exe

To compile it again on Windows, assuming you have mingw64 installed you can compile it in Powershell with: 
g++ -Wall -Wextra -g3 main.cpp -o main.exe -I"C:/SFML/include" -L"C:/SFML/lib" -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
